## |Making it a windows excecutable:|
- The python file must be compiled into an exe if you want it to work as intended due to python not being able to aquire sufficient permissions.
- To make an exe you must use auto-py-to-exe https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
-On auto-py-to-exe you must enable the option under > Advanced > uac-admin this will correctly obtain administrator privilages.
 ```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
You can create the executable via the graphic user interface
```
auto-py-to-exe
 ```
 or via the commandline refer to auto-py-to-exe documentation for more information https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
 ```
 pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --uac-admin  "C:/path_to_your_python_file.py"
 ```
